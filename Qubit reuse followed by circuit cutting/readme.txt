We took GHZ state, applied qubit reuse, put vertical cuts, got 2 subcircuits, unrolled them, stuck them together and got the cut locations in the corresponding static circuit.
This static circuit is the starting point of these 2 notebooks 15 Aug, 9 Aug
With help of barriers , we were able to get desired subcircuits
Yes, qubit reuse can show us the way to get lesser depth , lesser number of subcircuits.
