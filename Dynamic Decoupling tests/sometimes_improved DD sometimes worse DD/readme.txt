We have various combination of DD sequence, and 2 shedule passes- ALAP, ASAP
Dufferent combinations of above give different results
ASAP , dd sequence =X,X performed well (19 July) compared to 19 June results where static circuit Fidelity is improved while circuit 
obtained by plugin 's fidelity is increased only for 3 qubits GHZ circuit!
Further study is required in Dynamical decoupling to suppress idle errors
